| :warning:WARNING:warning: : These automatically generated documentations are somewhat inaccurate as they are inherited directly from Séléné V6. The Lua API has barely evolved, and ldoc is no longer suitable to support both the Lua API and the C API. |

This directory contains various documentations.

Lua's objects and function parts are automatically generated from source code as HTML pages.
Unfortunately, Github display HTML source code instead of content. Please follow links bellows for human-readable :

* [Séléné's own library](https://raw.githack.com/destroyedlolo/Selene/Doc/docs/Selene/) - tasks and functions managements, collections, shared objects, general purpose elements ...
* Plugins :
  * [Curses text based interface](http://raw.githack.com/destroyedlolo/Selene/v6/docs/Curses/) - text based semi-graphics
  * [DRM/Cairo graphical interface](http://raw.githack.com/destroyedlolo/Selene/v6/docs/DRMCairo/) - richely featured graphics
  * [OLed graphical interface](http://raw.githack.com/destroyedlolo/Selene/v6/docs/OLed/) - reduced tiny Oled display graphical interface
  * [DirectFB](http://raw.githack.com/destroyedlolo/Selene/v6/docs/DirectFB/) - obsolete
